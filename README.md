CoolKidChat is a web-based chat application that uses p5.js and the p5Party library
to satirically explore social dynamics through a digital lens. It features a unique
mechanism where only selected users can message, based on server criteria, in a limited
lobby size of four. Others can observe but cannot participate in the conversation, and
are presented with a choice:leave the chat with their dignity intact or quietly wait
for an opportunity to join the coveted cool kid group.

Have fun with it!
